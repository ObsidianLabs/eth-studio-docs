## Build

### Build Preparation

The Ethereum Studio can automatically detect the solidity version written at the head of contracts. One can select the specific version of the solidity compiler by clicking the "hammer" icon at the bottom right corner. Developers need to choose an appropriate version corresponding to the requirement of contracts.

### Build by Panel

In the desktop client, one can click the "hammer" icon below the "Project" panel or right-click the target file and select "Compile" to build a contract. The Ethereum Studio only supports building all contracts together, and the Ethereum Studio will release single file building later.

Developers can find Buiding difference between web and desktop clients inÂ **Chapter Install Desktop Client, Contrast with Web Client**.

### Build by Command Line

To build contracts manually, one can open the command line by clicking the "Terminal" icon and input the command through the "Project" panel. Please note that there must be the command same as the selected framework during project building. One can check the framework in "package.json". In "scripts", there will be corresponding commands for manually input in the command line.

### Check Building Details

After building successfully, the framework will build a newly created document named "build" containing a "contracts" document. In the "contracts" document, there will be all the JSON files generated by the building. Each file has the related contract's application binary interface(ABI). One will deploy ABI files on the network later.

## Deploy

After building projects, there are successfully generated ABI files required by later deploying. One can check the newly created "build" document in the project and find the JSON file with the target name to deploy.


### Deploy by Panel

One can right-click the file and select "Deploy" or click the "Docker" icon below the "Project" panel, and there will popup a "Deploy Contract" window.

### Deploy by Command Line

One can open the command line to deploy contracts manually by clicking the "Terminal" icon and input command through the "Project" panel. Please note that there must be the command same as the selected framework during project building. One can check the framework in "package.json". In "scripts", there will be corresponding commands for manually input in the command line.

### Deploy Preparation

There will be a "Deploy Contract" window in the deployment preparation process. This window can select a JSON file to deploy on the network.

Several "Constructor Parameters" are related to the constructor function parameters for users to input as desired.

In the "Deploy Contract" window, one can choose "Signer, " the final payer of gas fee and tip. One needs to ensure the signer has enough ETH on the interconnected network. Otherwise, the later "Estimate & Deploy" process will not be successful.

The "Estimate & Deploy" button is at the bottom right corner. There will be a real-time estimation of "Gas Limit", "Tip", and "Max Fee" located below. It will be significantly different for the estimation time and price. One should carefully check the network to deploy before deploying.

After estimating process, there is an exact price number on the corresponding box. If one feels the gas fee price is too high or the network is too busy, click the green "Re-estimate" button at the bottom left corner to estimate cost again. If one supposes the price is fair, click the purple "Deploy" button on the bottom right corner to deploy this contract.

### Check Deploy Transactions

After clicking "Deploy", one can check to deploy schedule by clicking the bottom "Transactions" button to select any transaction. One can check the detailed deployment process information with the popup "Deploy a Contract" window.

![Tb-15](/pic/Tb-15.png)

Five boxes show detailed information in the "Deploy a Contract" window. In the "Basic" panel, there are several most crucial pieces of information of this transaction, including address. One can click on the "Contract" address, and the "Contract" panel will show the contract functions for one to call.

## Project Settings

At the right end of the toolbar, a "gear" icon is named "Project Settings". Click it, and there will be the "Project Settings" panel in the editor. This panel is a graphic show of the "config.json" file. One can easily change the settings of the project.

### General

In the "General" part, the main file location is the default selection on the deploy choice.

There are also the framework and npm clients of this project. One should change the framework here and then use a new framework to build or deploy since there is a more detailed configuration.

One can change Npm client here and use a new client like yarn or cnpm. Please make sure one has installed other clients before and runs directly in the command line.

### Compilers

One can select the Truffle version while the default version is chosen when the project is built. The Solc version is identical to the pragma version in the solidity file. Developers can change the EVM version and Optimizer directly. The Ethereum Studio disabled Optimizer???

### Linter

Linters automatically analyze code for possible programmatic and styling errors. In "Project Settings", there are Solhint and Ethlint. One can choose a familiar lint to complete codes.

### Editor

In "Editor", one can choose a font-related configuration to make code more specific and direct as one desired.
