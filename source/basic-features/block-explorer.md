## Faucet

The running logic is the same in Ethereum networks, including mainnet and testnets. There would be a currency on the Ethereum network such as ETH and test ETH. Unlike ETH in the mainnet, test ETH on testnets has no real value. Therefore, there are no markets for testnet ETH. Since you need ETH actually to interact with Ethereum, most people get testnet ETH from faucets. Most faucets are web apps where you can input an address to which you request ETH be sent.

First, choose one of the Ethereum Testnets. Then set the account of Block Explorer. There is a "faucet" icon at the right end of the address box. Click the icon, and it will turn to the faucet page of that testnet. The Ethereum Studio only supports quick Link of Ropsten, Rinkeby and Kovan Faucet. One can still check the Gorli faucet link by oneself.

 

 

### Ropsten Faucet

Click the upper right "Faucet" icon, and the page will jump to the Ropsten Faucet. One can copy the wallet address in MetaMask and paste it into the box. Then one clicks the button "Send me test Ether" and wait for a few minutes. There will be 5 test ETH of Ropensten testnet on balance.

 

### Rinkeby Faucet 

Following getting test tokens via inputting specific Twitter or Facebook message links, one can get test ETH on Rinkeby. Although the Rinkeby faucet requires users to request test ETH in a certain period, one can change the amount of test ETH with different lengths of time.

 

### Kovan Faucet

## Account

In the "Account" panel, there are users' "Balance" and "Nounce". "Balance" represents the ETH amount of the user. The "Nounce" represents the transaction experience. Specifically, the nonce in the ETH wallet is a scalar value equal to the number of transactions sent from this address or, in the case of accounts with associated code, the number of contract creations made by this account. The nonce can be changed manually. 

 

 

 

## Information

Input one of the contract address in the search box. After pressing down the "Enter" button on the keyboard, the detailed information is shown on the "Information" panel. There is the "Code Hash" of the contract in the search box in the picture.

 

 

 

## Transactions

In the "Transactions" panel, there is the specific information of each transaction on the address, including "Time", "Blockheight", "Transaction Hash"， "Owner Address", "Receiver Address", "Value" and so on. One can check the colour of the transaction value to know the input or the output of ETH since the input is green and the output is read. Besides, there is detailed information of the receiver address reminding the action meaning of the receiver address. One can click on the address link to show the address in Block Explorer to check the detailed information.
