# Login

Clicking the upper right corner "User" icon will be a window jumping out. One can log in through a Github account, and the Ethereum Studio will restore this account so one can log in quickly in the latter. After login, one can start one's project or create a new project through the button of the "Project" panel.

 

 

 

## My Projects

Before login, one can click "My Projects" to check all projects in the local desktop client. In contrast, in the Ethereum Studio Web client, one can only check the projects in the cloud.

 

 

After login through a Github account, one can click user name and check all projects, including "Local" and "Cloud". Users can check all projects in the cloud through the Ethereum Studio Web client. 

 

 

## Ethereum Studio Web

Click "Ethereum Studio Web" will be a page directed to the Ethereum Studio Web client with Link ([https://eth.ide.black/](https://eth.ide.black/HanYouyang)User-Name-Logged-In). One can develop their Cloud projects in the web client with browser extensions, including MetaMask. 

## Github Repo

By clicking "Github Repo", there will be a page directed to the Github project page of the Ethereum Studio. One can download the latest release of the Ethereum Studio Desktop client and do all other things in Github.

 

 

 

## Report an Issue

Click "Report an Issue," and there will be a page directed to the Link ([https://github.com/ObsidianLabs/EthereumStudio/issues/new](https://github.com/ObsidianLabs/EthereumStudio/issues/new)). One can immediately report any error message or bug of the Ethereum Studio itself. This would be a great help for our team to improve this IDE for better service. Thank you for your issue!

 

 

 

## Log out

One can log out by clicking "Log out" and login another account. Please make sure that the Github account logged before has signed out through the Github page of one's account. Then one can log in to the Ethereum Studio via another Github account.
