# Contract

In "Contract" panel, there are three panels from left to right. Each panel represents "Write Functions", "View Functions" and "Events" respectively. Developers can interact with "Write Functions", mainly calling functions with assets and check the address status with "View Functions". Besides, developers can set parameters and check related events in "Events".

### Gas

If developers want to call functions, there would be some gas fee and tip required by the miner. Especially when the network is congested, the gas fee can be very large, so developers should set a "Max Fee" in case of an unexpectedly high cost. Developers can click the purple "Estimate" button to get the real-time gas price of deploying contract on network. If developers supposes the price is not fair, they can click again or wait for a period and the Ethereum Studio will show changed price.
