# QuickStart
## Login web client

Click the "Login" icon on the bottom of "not logged in". Otherwise, click the upper right corner and click the "Login" on the panel.

Users login through their Github accounts, in the Ethereum Studio. Once logged, users log again through Github information automatically. The Ethereum Studio will not keep users' accounts information.

## Create an ERC20 project

After login, create a new project by clicking the green button with "New".


![Qk-2](/pic/Qk-2.png)


Create an ERC20 project in Ethereum Studio. Set "Project" as "tokenTransfer" and "Template" as "ERC20 Token". The project will be automatically saved in Ethereum Studio's cloud under one's account. Then click the purple button at the bottom left corner to create.

After the project is created, the ERC20 contracts have been generated successfully.

## Connect to MetaMask Account

A MetaMask wallet pop up in the web client to login through users' passwords. Suppose a user does not have a MetaMask account. Please refer to the [MetaMask register introduction](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).

After linking to the MetaMask, copy the mnemonic into the Keypair Manager for later deploying contracts.Â Click the purple key icon on the bottom left corner and then click the "Import" button and paste the mnemonic words, 12 English Words representing the private key. Finally, give this imported private key a name, and the Etereum Studio will save it under this account in the cloud.

## Request Ropsten Faucet

After choosing the "Network" and "Explorer", click the upper right "Faucet" icon and get the request page of testETH on the testnet. Choose "Ropsten" testnet and click the icon to turn to the request page.


![Qk-6](/pic/Qk-6.png)

Click the upper right "Faucet" icon, and the page will jump to the Ropsten Faucet. One can copy the wallet address in MetaMask and paste it into the box. Then clicks the button "Send me test Ether" and wait for a few minutes.


![Qk-7](/pic/Qk-7.png)

With all the requests finished, there will be 5 testETH in the wallet address on Ropsten test network.


![Qk-8](/pic/Qk-8.png)

Back to the web client, check the balance if there is 5 testETH on the test network, Ropsten.

## Build Contracts

There is three Solidity files in the "ERC20/contracts/" file in the left panel after successfully creating the project. Select one of the contract and click the "Hammer" icon to build the contract.


![Qk-10](/pic/Qk-10.png)

Now this IDE only supports building all contracts together. Single-file compilation will come soon in the later version.

## Deploy Contracts

After a successful building, deploy the ERC20 contract on the Ropsten testnet. Select the JSON file "ERC20.json".

![Qk-12](/pic/Qk-12.png)

Then set "name_" as "test", "symbol_" as "TEST" and totalSupply as "3000000000".

![Qk-13](/pic/Qk-13.png)

Select the signer as the keypair saved in Keypair Manager. If there is no choice, please check the chapter **Keypair Manager**.

![Qk-14](/pic/Qk-14.png)

Set the "Tip" as desired amount, or generate it with "Gas Limit" and "Max Fee" together by clicking the bottom right button to "Estimate". There will be the estimated fee in real-time. If the fee is not reasonable, click the "Re-estimate" or wait for a non-congestion period.

![Qk-15](/pic/Qk-15.png)

After deploying successfully, a window with detailed transaction information will pop up. Now the contract has been deployed at the address: 0xF30438E789b361Eca03B3C7AB8cB176e436C7259. Click the address to turn to the "Contract" interface.

![Qk-16](/pic/Qk-16.png)

## Check Balance and Transfer

Since 5 test ETH is far enough for paying fees, choose the "transfer" function from the purple inverted triangle icon. Select the "recipient" as the target address and set the token amount to transfer as 1000. Click the purple "Estimate" button to set "Parameters" and "Gas" automatically.

![Qk-17](/pic/Qk-17.png)

After all the parameters are settled, click the triangle icon beside "transfer" to execute a function.

![Qk-18](/pic/Qk-18.png)

After the compeletion of "PUSHING" state, the contract is deployed successfully with the "CONFIRMED" state. Select "Explorer" on the upper right panel to see the past transaction detail.

![Qk-19](/pic/Qk-19.png)

After transferring the 1000 "TEST" token, click the upper right "Explorer" to see the left balance of 4.997 test ETH now. The balance consumed by the "Gas Fee" and "Tip" will not be 5 testETH for deploying and calling a contract.
