## Open Zeppelin

Open Zeppelin provides a complete suite of security products to build, manage, and inspect all aspects of software development and operations for Ethereum projects. 


In the Ethereum Studio, one can import Open Zeppelin contracts through the template. Detailed information about Open Zeppelin can be referred to **as Link (**[https://docs.openzeppelin.com/openzeppelin/](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/openzeppelin/)**)**.


## Hardhat

Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug Ethereum software. It helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to the process of building smart contracts and dApps and quickly introduces more functionality around this workflow. This framework means compiling, running and testing smart contracts at the very core.


In the Ethereum Studio, one can use Hardhat as a development framework. Developers can choose it during the creation of projects. One can also use this framework during the development process by the command line in the Ethereum Studio. Detailed information about Hardhat can be referred to **Link (**[https://hardhat.org/getting-started/](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/)**)**.


## Truffle

Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). With Truffle, users get a built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management. Truffle also has network management for deploying to any number of public & private networks.


In the Ethereum Studio, one can use Hardhat as a development framework. Developers can choose it during the creation of projects. One can also use this framework during the development process by the command line in the Ethereum Studio. Detailed information about Hardhat can be referred to **Link (**[https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/)**)**.


Dockerized Truffle used only Truffle in Docker image without other dependencies like Node.js and Npm in local. The other two Frameworks, Hardhat and Waffle, require Node.js and Npm.


## Waffle

Waffle is a library for writing and testing smart contracts. Sweeter, simpler and faster than Truffle. In Waffle, "Simpler" means minimalistic, few dependencies; "Sweeter" means nice syntax, easy to extend; "Faster" means to focus on the speed of tests execution. Waffle uses a set of chai matches, and it can import contracts from npm modules easily. There is also a fast compilation with native and dockerized solidity contracts. It provides fixtures that help write fast and maintainable test suites.


In the Ethereum Studio, one can use Waffle as a development framework. Developers can choose it during the creation of projects. One can also use this framework during the development process by the command line in the Ethereum Studio. Detailed information about Waffle can be referred to **Link (**[https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**)**.

# Transaction History

## Transaction Detail

After calling functions, developers can check the transaction status in the "Transaction" button at the bottom of IDE. Click the function name one want to match, and there will be a popup "Call a Contract" window.

There is detailed information about the transaction in the "Call a Contract" window. In this window, the contract address means where the function is called. There is other detailed information for one to see in different panels.
